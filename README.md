# Marketplace-Frontend - Technical documentation

## Overview
Marketplace Application - [Functional Documentation](https://github.com/kristophermt3z/Marketplace/blob/main/README.md)

## Description
This is the frontend for a marketplace, implemented using React. This frontend connects with a backend REST API to manage operations related to sellers and other marketplace resources.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. This project was created with `create-react-app`.

## Installation
To install and set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salvadormartin3z/Marketplace-Frontend
   cd Marketplace-Frontend

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a .env file in the root of the project with the following variables necessary for the backend connection and other important configurations.

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```

   Note: The .env file is not included in the repository for security reasons. You must create your own .env file locally.

4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   This will compile the application and open a window in your default browser. If the browser does not open automatically, you can manually access http://localhost:3000.

5. You will also need to install and set up the project's backend for full functionality:
